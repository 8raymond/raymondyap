  aboutMe:
    "Hi! My name is Raymond Yap and I am a studying mechanical engineer in my 4th year at Northeastern University. I have designed, prototyped, and built hardware across many contexts ranging from aerospace robotics to industrial automation systems. I dedicate myself towards optimizing designs to their maximum efficiency in both functionality and/or cost, while utilizing CAD, analysis, and Engineering First Principles. I’ve previously worked 2 co-ops (6 mo. each), one at Blue Origin (Honeybee Robotics), and the other at Instron under the automation team. (see experiences). Between NASA contracted lunar landers and 6-axis robotic arms, I’ve functioned as a full-time mechanical engineer across a multitude of industries and design constraints. Born and raised in the Bay Area, I love hiking through redwoods and enjoying Monterey Bay beaches whenever possible. I also play badminton as my main sport and am currently part of the Northeastern Club Badminton team.",
